There are 20,000 to 25,000 contacts present on the website

You need to deal with it as well as any other technical issue yourself. I don't want my login account to be restricted please. 

Problem is that when you search 1000 contacts the website limits your search functionality and you cannot get more than 1000 records per search. So the solution is that you can search 1000 contacts using one search criteria and then another search criteria to get another 1000 and then another search criteria to get another 1000 and this is the way you can get all 20k to 25k contacts. With a single search you cannot get 25k data as after reaching 1000 contacts they block your search functionality and you cannot explore more than 1000 contacts per search. 

For example you search the Texas state of the USA and get 1000 results and then search another state and get 1000 results copied and so on and you search by cities name in a state where a state has more than 1000 contacts to get all records from that state.

What Neuropathy symptoms are you experiencing?
How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
I'm sorry to hear you've been suffering like that.
Based on the severity of your symptoms/case, I’m gonna block out an hour of time with Dr. Chris. He’s helped thousands of patients, and he’s definitely the doctor you’re gonna wanna se.
We would love to offer you a free consultation and neuropathy review with the doctor to determine the severity of your symptoms. Would you like to take advantage of this?
Do mornings or afternoons work better for you?
How does Monday at 10:00 a.m. sound? Or does 3:00 p.m. sound better?
Perfect, I’ll make sure to schedule you for Monday at 3:00 PM.
Is there anyone in your house that makes healthcare decisions with you? (spouse, child, family)
It is important that they come to the appointment as Dr Chris will be sharing valuable information with you.

What to expect during the initial visit?
“Just so there’s no surprises, here’s what to expect during your initial visit. So when you get to the clinic, we’re going to do a neuropathy review [$75 value]. The doctor will also perform a $150 Test, known as the Computerized Balance Test – this will help us determine if there is nerve damage. We’re going to test whether your brain and feet are in coordination or if you’re having trouble balancing; otherwise, that’s a high indicator of nerve damage. After the screening, we’re going to perform a Thermography Scan ($150 value) to determine whether the nerves on either your hands or feet are getting enough blood flow, for it to be able to heal. 
So all together, you’d be getting $375-worth of diagnostic tests for FREE because we want to make sure that you’re a good candidate to qualify for the treatment before you invest your money.”

We are scheduling you with the doctor for an hour, so we want to triple check that Monday at 10am works for you and (spouse, daughter…person they make medical decisions with) Great, the doctor will meet you Monday at 3:00 p.m. You'll be receiving a text message with our address. Do you wish to write it down?
You’ll also receive a link to our online Application For Care form. Kindly fill that one out as that will give you the most time to meet with the doctor to discuss your case.
If you don’t have the chance to fill it out online, kindly come to the office 30 mins early.
Great, Antonio, we look forward to seeing you and your spouse for your appointment with Dr Chris..

I’m Alex, I offer email marketing services to e-commerce businesses (consumer goods), I’m looking for someone who can generate leads and someone who can take care of cold email outreach - or, preferably, someone who can do both.
Here are some details:

LEAD GENERATION:
The leads will have to be listed in a Google Sheet with Company Name, Company website, yearly revenue, Employee number, First & Last name (C-level), email address.
The target leads are e-commerce stores (customer goods) that follow these criteria:
Yearly revenue under 1 million (ideal revenue range: 480K-600K)
Employees number under 10 (ideal employees number 1-6)
Location: US, UK, or Canada
Industries to avoid: female-only apparel & accessories, high ticket jewelry, luxury goods | Suggested industries: male & female apparel & accessories, outdoor gear & apparel, home products, foods & beverages, pet products, kid products, health & wellness, plant products, fitness products, other…

COLD EMAIL OUTREACH:
I currently have a business email that I’m using to send 30-40 emails per day, and my sequence includes 1 initial cold email and 3 follow-ups.
I’m looking for someone who can manage all of that for me using a cold email software, and optimize the results by increasing sending volumes and improving the strategy where needed - for example, suggestions about timings, personalization, scripts (with my collaboration), follow-ups, deliverability, etc.
To summarize, the ideal person should take care of the outreach process with the method he/she thinks is more efficient to get lead replies.
__

To apply, simply let me know if you would be able to fulfill the Lead Generation role or the Cold Email role - or both of them (ideal option).

Develop Python3/Selenium script to monitor specific Website w/ Custom HTML Email / SMTP Alerting,2 weeks ago,"Looking for skilled and experienced Python / Selenium developer to build a clean and robust custom  scripts to effectively webscrape / monitor this URL with logging in case of errors: https://www.mass511.com/list/signs?sortDirection=DESC&sortBy=ROADWAY&page=1&pageRecordLimit=150

All Python / Selenium code will need to be commented and the execution environment where this will be running is on a Windows 2022 Server local environment. 

Bonus points for someone who has an eye for design as SMTP / email notifications would need to be integrated in the script (maybe separate email scripts which can be invoked depending on certain parameters). Experience with inline CSS / Bootstrap Email would be great as I want it to be responsive and email design to look consistent across Outlook web, desktop, and iOS email views. https://bootstrapemail.com/docs/introduction

More specifically, this URL links to the Go Time Boards List page which should display 148 sign results. The goal of this script is to run checks on this page to verify 148 signs are listed and if there are less than 148 signs available then list which specific signs are not present. How this works is that signs which are down are removed from the page (example is if one sign is down then the total display count will be 147 instead of 148). 

Condition 1:
If 1 to 5 signs are detected as being down then I'd want a separate email / smtp alert to fire off with a list of the unavailable signs with a custom email subject line (e.g. medium alert). I would also want a Selenium Webdriver screenshot to be taken of a specific element on the webpage and embedded in the email as well (with base64 encoding). 

Condition 2: 
If more than 5 signs are detected as being down then I'd want a separate email / smtp alert to fire off with a list of the unavailable signs with a custom email subject line (e.g. critical alert). I would also want a Selenium Webdriver screenshot to be taken of a specific element on the webpage and embedded in the email as well (with base64 encoding).

Need Phantom (or similar) expert that can help me,3 weeks ago,"Hi there,

I am in the process of setting up some marketing and data extraction systems for our commercial real estate company.  I am interested in any and all resources that I can eventually pay for and utilize (out of the box kind of solutions) internally eventually OR you could become a contracted member of our team long term.

To start with I'd like to know what https://phantombuster.com/ can do for this.  I need to find LinkedIn URL's from a data list for example.  Also how can I utilize this to grab FB Group information so we can have a VA friend/chat with everyone that has interests that align with our solutions?  Also how can we create our own internal data base of FB Group members names, numbers, emails, etc.  Assuming we could use a few Phantoms to get this result?

Let's start with Phantom and go from there.  Please provide your experience level with this product (or similar possibly if you have a better one) when it comes to extracting data & grabbing profile URL's, etc.  I want someone that can understand what we're trying to accomplish and how these types of solutions can benefit me (basically teach me what can be done).

Demographics of potential clients we're searching for:

~Owners of commercial real estate in select geo (I have this data list but we need to find them on social media, see attached for an example)
~Potential lenders (high net worth individuals that are interested in lending or getting their money to work for them using us and real estate)
~Real estate agents and brokers that have properties available or know someone that wants to sell
~Wholesalers and birddogs that are interested in helping us find properties 
~etc.

The way we'd use the data/info right now:

~FB outreach (VA)
~LinkedIn outreach (VA)
~Cold Calls
~ Mailers to their homes
~ Texting
~etc

Any automations we can get going would be a big plus as well.  Our 2 main needs right now are commercial real estate properties (multifamily and NNN retail for example) and Capital Partners (high net worth individuals to share our different capital raise options with)

Thank you!

2.	Last Name
3.	Company Name

5.	LinkedIn URL

1.	Company Headcount (select all, except 1-10)
2.	Current job title (Portfolio Manager & Senior Portfolio Manager)
3.	Geography (United Kingdom)
4.	Industry (Investment Management, Investment Banking)

In order to capture all available leads, we should filter each search by “Years of experience”.

Please start with:
“More than 10 years” = 1.5k+ search results
“6 to 10 years” = 333 search results
“3 to 5 years” = 76 results
“1 to 2 years” = 24 results
This should total: 1933 leads

Then repeat the same search, using the same filters however this time replace (Investment Management & Investment Banking) with “Financial Services” and repeat the same process with “Years of experience”.

“More than 10 years” = 3.5k+ search results
“6 to 10 years” = 920 search results
“3 to 5 years” = 225 results
“1 to 2 years” = 88 results
This should total: 4,733 leads

Yes, there are several ways an AI or automated system could be designed to notify you about new senior living communities with over 100 units being built in Wake County, NC. Here are a few options:

1. **Web Scraping**: An AI system can be developed to automatically scrape relevant websites, such as real estate developers, local government planning departments, and senior living community websites for information about new construction projects in Wake County.

2. **RSS Feeds**: Many local government websites and real estate companies offer RSS feeds for new construction projects and developments. An AI system can be designed to monitor these feeds for relevant information about senior living communities.

Marketing Automation and Lead Gen (possibly using Bardeen),4 weeks ago,"Overview :
I am looking to contact the people who are currently advertising a job on Linkedin. I believe this is straightforward using Bardeen.

What we do
We sell a service to people that are recruiting and interviewing job candidates.

What we want
I want to add these contacts to my Leads list and campaigns that Instantly.ai is running, so that they automatically get sent a series of campaign emails once they are added to the lead list.

I also have several sales agents, whose job it is to phone the leads and turn them into customers. Ultimately they just want to open up a spreadsheet, or Hubspot and find relevant people to contact by phone and email.

I think some marketing automation using Bardeen can do all of the above.

Who do we sell to
We sell to organisations that recruit every month.
Organisations that are currently advertising a job on LinkedIn also make good prospects, as the timing is good and they provide contact details in the “Meet the hiring team” section.

Typical job titles we deal with are;
CEO
Sales Manager
HR Manager

Automation Example #1 - LinkedIn Jobs
Search Linkedin Jobs using a specific keyword (e.g: cyber security) and search criteria. 
[keyword - jobtitle] in Jobs section + [location] 

Changes to the keyword or the location would be a separate campaign going to a separate spreadsheet and a separate campaign on Instantly.ai.
Select a Location : (UK)
Scrape and Copy the job details to a Google Spreadsheet

Meet the hiring team - Some jobs also have a section called “meet the hiring team”, where we find the individual responsible for promoting the job. Add their contact details to the job record in the spreadsheet.

Firstname
Surname

Lead Generation,5 weeks ago,"Hello,
my name is Alex, I take care of email marketing for ecommerce brands and I’m currently looking for a person who can help me with lead generation and outreach.

- Outreach: sending outreach messages to qualified leads. If a lead replies, I will handle it; if a lead doesn’t reply, you’ll be responsible for follow-up. Every message’s script will be provided by me, but you can always propose improvements or different messages.
- Technical setup: managing the private domain (in case of business email), email deliverability, email scraping and verification, various outreach software, etc.

Overall, the ideal person should be able to handle every step of the outreach process with the method he thinks is more efficient to get lead replies (cold email preferred, cold calling excluded). The only conditions are sticking to the provided criteria and sharing with me basic information such as the method you will be outreaching with, the updated lead list, the messages’ script, and the overall results (replies, follow-ups, etc.)

Condos & HOAs Leads Enriching & Compiling - w. email mergeable ROOFTOP IMAGES,last month,"SEEKING intelligent, experienced, skilled, HONEST & FAST / creative lead appending & compiling assistants - to help “enrich”, expand & complete existing Excel spreadsheet formatted unique records of Condominiums, Co-op Apartments & Homeowner Associations (""HOAs"") in Miami-Dade, Monroe, Broward & Palm Beach Counties (in South Florida, USA) - to begin with – complete with VALID Phone #’s & Email Address(es).  Valid Property Manager Names are highly desirable and records with this information will be paid for at a higher rate per record – but record with all other critical info but without the Property Manager names will still be suitable and paid for.

After the Miami–Dade list(s) are finished, I’ll be building the same kind of lists for every county in the State of Florida, USA – so it’s a BIG, ONGOING job!  PAYMENT is not “by the hour”, but rather PER COMPLETED LEAD

Existing lists I will provide you with are missing critical info of every kind.
EXAMPLES:  

	Some have names and addresses of Condos/HOAs, but no Property Manager, Phone#  or Email address(es).  
	Others have Property Manager w. Phone & Email - but no names or address(es) of the Condo/HOA Property(ies) they manage.  
	Still others contain Condo / HOA names & addresses w phone numbers – but no email address(es) (which are essential/critical to each record).

FURTHERMORE - even records with all (Property Manager name, Condo/HOA name & address, Property Manager and/or HOA President Phone Number(s) and Email Address(es) ARE NOT YET COMPLETE!

ADDITIONAL CRITICAL INFO REQUIRED (in additional Columns/Headings) IS:

	ROOF CONDITION  (Perfect, Good, Fair, Bad, Terrible)
	UGLY ROOF IMAGES (snippets of rooftops obtained from Bing … (the most recent, up to date images)… Maps).  Examples provided for clarity.  

Upwork won’t permit my “per lead” payment amount, so:
Entries/Records without this additional information are useless/VOID – and will not be paid for.
Entries/Records without all required information, i.e.: Condo/HOA Name & Address, CURRENT & VALID Property Manager Phone Number(s) & Email Address(es) are useless/VOID – and will not be paid for.  (Property Manager NAME is the only data point that, while very desirable, is not critical – however, I will pay less for records without the Property Manager name)

Good candidates must have a total command of website scraping and appending scraped data to Excel Files.  Ideal candidates would have the skills to build their own programs to accomplish my goals.

Prospective Unique Records/Leads number in the 100’s of 1000’s.  I believe that a phone call to prospects (to obtain Property Manager name, best phone numbers and email addresses) must sometimes be made - so FLUENCY IN ENGLISH IS REQUIRED.  SLIGHT ACCENT OK – A HEAVY/THICK FOREIGN ACCENT DISQUALIFIES POTENTIAL JOB CANDIDATES FROM MAKING PHONE CALLS (this doesn’t mean you couldn’t have a co-worker who is fluent in lightly accented English make the necessary calls for you - as a team)

Spanish as a 1st language is OK since Miami-Dade, Florida USA is 70% Spanish-speaking, but callers must still speak fluent, easy-to-understand English.

List Builder for Cold Email Outreach - Data Entry & Qualification,last month,"Hey list builders & data entry experts,

I'm looking to get a consistent cadence of list builds per month, starting with 3-5k leads in my niche per month.

I have a good rhythm and want to keep it up by being able to message the CEO/Founder or Head of Marketing (1-2 contacts per company) every month and scale that KPI as we keep building.

I'll share info on my lead list criteria, and you should be well-versed with the following tools,

- Apollo,
- ListKit,
- Sales Navigator
- other lead gen scrapers

And also, be able to qualify ONLY the niche businesses we're looking for and weed out the rest, making a high-quality, targeted contact list for our industry.

I've got a very detailed S.O.P. that will make your job a lot easier.

Lastly, you'll need to use our mass-customization process so we can send personalized first lines, using GPT for Google Sheets.

It's easy - we'll give you the formula, but you'll need to check for accuracy and make sure the results it pulls are correct, with some light editing.

You up for the challenge? If you read this post, include the word Chameleon in your first word of your cover letter.

And share a few targeted examples of your list builds with me so I can review (only 2-3 is fine).

I am looking for a VA to visit each website and find the owner's Full Name and First Name.

Additionally, you should already be subscribed to Snov.io, FindThatLead or Prospeo to find business or personal emails.

The reason this is important is because some of the leads have ""info@ "" as the emails.

We do not want this email, we want the owner's business email.

That's why we use Snov.io, FindThatLead, or Prospeo.

Each week I will send you a list of 300 local businesses, and you will complete the task in 72 hours.

It's very simple.

You'll be paid $10 for each list you complete, meaning you can easily earn $40/month.

I only like working with people who have a positive attitude and are honest, so if you've read this entire job posting and watched the video above, please include with phrase ""I am committed to doing great work"" somewhere in your proposal.

You will be autonomous in this role.

Every Wednesday, I'll send you a list, and you can submit it to me anytime within 72 hours. I will not keep checking in with you or rush you.

For every 10 lists completed you will receive a bonus.

Then to find each business Facebook page.

Then to check email from their Website and/or Facebook page and update on the spreadsheet.
Finished Product to be delivered in Excel File like attached Seafood file

Please do not apply if you can only do manual scraping, you must be able to do automated or script based scraping.

This task is to make requests to Google Maps for 2977 postcodes in Australia. 
For the category - ""Promotional products supplier""

Attached is a spreadsheet with ALL Australian Postcodes (Column E) and Suburbs. Please use only the Postcodes, so you will need to remove duplicates of the postocdes. There is 2977 Postcodes.

Do not use Suburbs or Cities to Search as there is over 16,000 variations and too many requests.

Australia Postcodes are  ALWAYS 4 digits and numbers only. So many start with zero like 0080, 0801, 0840 etc, so please ensure you mainatian any that start with zero. SO watch your formatting on this.
Then search for all business and find their Facebook page and save that link.
Then go their facebook page and/or website to check and update their email address.

You will need to use your own server/Google Cloud or AWS account. We will not provide this.

This is a trial for a much larger and ongoing task which is similar in nature to this work.",/jobs/Google-Maps-Data-Extraction_~01af4abd2af3e38fec/?referrer_url_path=/nx/search/jobs,$75.00,Fixed price,"D;a;t; ;S;c;r;p;i;n;g;,;E;x;o;M;G;l;e;s;A;P;I",
